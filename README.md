# Clinic App

Rebuilding my final year project, which allowed users to book appointments through a mobile app to a specific clinic. 

üëâüèº The app is <a href='https://github.com/KevinRaleie-dev/radiant-clinic'>here</a>

But on this rebuild i want it to be a bit more generic, meaning i want people to have access to multiple clinics in their area while also allowing me to learn graphql and typescript by building such a big project.

This is the tech stack im planning on using, might change in the future as im building this:

### Backend.

- GraphQL
- ApolloServer
- PostgreSQL
- Node.JS
- Express
- TypeORM
- Docker
- AWS
- Github / Github actions
- Last but not least, K8s

### Frontend.

- React Native / Next.JS
- Apollo Client / Urql
- ChakraUI
- Formik
- Github / Github actions
- Cloudflare
